<p><strong>Please note:</strong>
  Our public events are still on pause due to COVID-19. We expect them to resume in 2022.</p>

<h3>Open nights</h3>

If you'd like to visit Limehouse Labs we have a regular open night on Mondays. Access to the building is slightly tricky, so if you'd like to drop by please let us know in advance!
