## SCT LED Screen

This is a relatively high-res LED screen, which is slightly damaged and missing one component.
It's a bit of a project and we don't have time for it.

* 360x640 resolution LED screen
* Approximately 1mm pixel pitch
* Some damage to pixels around the edge
* In flight case (approx 10-15 kg)
* C&Light (former name for Colorlight) receiver cards, **one card missing**
* No sender/processor
* Weird expensive-looking connector carrying both mains power and Ethernet
