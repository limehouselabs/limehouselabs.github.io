Membership of Limehouse Labs is currently limited to a maximum of 25 members. New members are added to the waiting list after being nominated by existing members, and every existing member has an anonymous veto over new members joining.

The membership fee is currently £30/month, payable by direct debit, although this may be reduced as membership grows. If you're concerned about the cost, we may be able to reduce this.

We expect members to use the space at least every three months. If you are no longer active we may ask you to step aside to allow a new member to join.

If you're interested in joining, please come to our [public open events](/events) and have a chat with some of the members!
